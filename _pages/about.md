ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Priyam, an MSCS (Research Track) student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work with **[Dr. Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/)** in the PL/FM/SE group. My research interests lie at the intersection of **programming languages**, **formal methods**, and **machine learning.**

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring **Specification Synthesis**, building techniques to translate informal developer intent into formal specifications inside **Interactive Theorem Provers.** My work focuses on building domain-adapted language models and designing iterative feedback-driven repair strategies using neuro-symbolic methods. This includes developing math- and logic-oriented LLMs to investigate how structured reasoning can drive greater reliability and deeper alignment with formal mathematics.

Before joining grad school, I worked at **[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en)** on **[Ansible Lightspeed](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/ansible-lightspeed)**, an LLM-powered coding assistant for Ansible-Yaml code generation, now used by thousands of developers. I designed the **[Ansible Language Server](https://ansible-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, adapting language server protocol ideas with techniques from programming languages and static analysis to provide rich code-editor support; from syntax-aware diagnostics to semantic auto-completion, bringing accessibility to Ansible development in the open-source community.

I am always happy to talk about logic, verification, and how to make AI reason a little more like a mathematician. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat. When Iâ€™m away from the keyboard, you can usually find me playing tennis or practicing boxing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
